Description: A synthetic sports dataset inspired by Calvinball, the legendary 
    game from Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes comic strip. The package 
    provides chaotic game results, player statistics, and team records designed 
    for teaching data exploration and EDA techniques. Features include wildly 
    unpredictable scoring (including negative scores!), multiple scoring systems, 
    and absurd performance metrics like "spontaneous rule declarations" and 
    "time reversal bonuses".
