\title{Generate Fresh Calvinball League Data}
\usage{
generate_calvinball_data(
  n_players = 30,
  n_teams = 6,
  n_games = 50,
  n_seasons = 3,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_players}{Number of players to generate (default: 30)}

\item{n_teams}{Number of teams (default: 6)}

\item{n_games}{Number of games per season (default: 50)}

\item{n_seasons}{Number of seasons (default: 3)}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed for reproducibility (though Calvinball
shouldn't be reproducible!)}
}
\value{
A list containing six tibbles:
\describe{
  \item{players}{Player roster with team assignments}
  \item{teams}{Team information}
  \item{games}{Game results with scores and winners}
  \item{player_stats}{Individual player game statistics}
  \item{player_summary}{Aggregated player career statistics}
  \item{team_records}{Team win/loss/tie records by season}
}
}
\description{
Generates a complete set of Calvinball League data including players,
teams, games, and statistics. Each call produces different results
(unless a seed is set), staying true to the Calvinball spirit that
"you can't play it the same way twice!"
}
\details{
The generated data includes intentionally chaotic elements:
\itemize{
  \item Scores can be negative (about 15\% of games)
  \item Some games have extreme scores in the thousands (about 10\%)
  \item Eight different scoring systems are used randomly
  \item Ties are possible
}
}
\examples{
# Generate with default parameters
data <- generate_calvinball_data()
names(data)

# Generate a smaller league
small_league <- generate_calvinball_data(
  n_players = 12,
  n_teams = 3,
  n_games = 20,
  n_seasons = 1
)

# Reproducible generation (against the spirit of Calvinball, but useful for testing)
data1 <- generate_calvinball_data(seed = 42)
data2 <- generate_calvinball_data(seed = 42)
identical(data1, data2)  # TRUE

}
